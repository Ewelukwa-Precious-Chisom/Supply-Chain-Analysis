### Exploratory Data Analysis
-	Average delay by driver.
-	Average delay By vehicle.
-	Average delay By route.
-	Average delay by allocation rule.
-	Customer distribution delay average.
-	Average delay by city.
### Results/Findings.
-	767 out of 1500 orders are not complete which can also lead to customer dissatisfaction.
-	Average delay time may accumulate overtime if neglected.
-	Orders with positive feedback have the highest delays which means that asides the delays, other factors can also contribute to customer’s satisfaction which includes good customer service and product quality.
-	Driver D86 has the highest which suggests that there might be routing obstacles and resource allocation inefficiencies.
-	Route 1,2 and 3 show higher delays than the others therefore, routes should be investigated for major obstacles.
### Recommendations
-	Spread out deliveries more evenly so no driver is overloaded.
-	Find smarter, faster routes to avoid traffic and roadblocks.
-	Improve communication by sending quick alerts for delays so customers aren’t left wondering.
-	Custom rule may be needing improvement since they perform better.
